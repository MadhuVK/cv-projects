# Computer Vision Projects

Computer vision projects investigating navigation, mapping, and object recognition using [Optical Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow) methods (such as Lucas-Kanade and Horn-Schunck).

This repository is a consolidation and record of the source code, which was written between 2011-2014 prior to using source control, and should be paired with the resulting papers.

## Papers

- [Edge-based Crowd Detection from Single Image Datasets](https://ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-12-1-1-18-22.pdf)
- [Autonomous Mapping and Navigation Through Utilization of Edge-Based Optical Flow and Time-To-Collision](https://www.arpnjournals.com/jeas/research_papers/rp_2012/jeas_1212_836.pdf)
